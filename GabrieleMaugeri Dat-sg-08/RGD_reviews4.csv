Razer Game Deals,09/03/2017,,"This is a really well designed app that is very easy and simple to use and is one of the best gaming deals apps I've seen. However, I would like if it included things like bundles when looking for the prices of games because often you can actually buy games cheaper as part of a bundle (such as humble bundle) than otherwise. Likewise for things like the revealed game on humble monthly or the like. Apart from that, it's a really great app.",Carl Buchanan,4,
